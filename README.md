## 🚴🏽‍♀️ About Me

My name's James (Walker). I'm a **"Middle-End" Web Developer** specializing in **React** in the front-end (alongside its various frameworks) and **NodeJS** on the back.

👨🏽‍🎓 I like to always be in the process of learning new technologies. Last year, I learned **Svelte/SveleteKit**, **GraphQL**, **Typescript** and **WebGL** (through the lens of react-three-fiber). I am currently a **Freelancer** working mostly in eCommerce.

🤸🏽‍♂️ Even outside of my developer life I enjoy building and refining things (including myself!). My preoccupations range from [**cycling up mountains**](https://www.strava.com/athletes/379856), **language learning** (Vietnamese, currently), and **gardening**, to some more niche stuff like **building mechanical keyboards** (DD is an Akko MOD007), and **speedcubing** ("speed" is probably an overstatement at this point 😅). 

In a past life I was a professional musician (piano & trombone), but I still enjoy playing and composing today.
